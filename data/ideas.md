# Project Ideas for Echo Playground

This document outlines a series of innovative project ideas for the Echo Playground application. It compares the feasibility of these ideas based on the old and new student data sets.

## Data Sets Overview

### Old Data Set:

- Basic metrics: average daily attendance, absence count, infraction count.
- Limitation: Provides a limited view of student performance and engagement.

### New Data Set:

- Enriched metrics: student name, grade level, GPA, extracurricular participation, parental involvement, online learning engagement, proficiency levels in reading and math, and more.
- Advantage: Offers a nuanced understanding of student performance, behavior, and engagement.

## Sample Data

### New Data Sample:

```csv
