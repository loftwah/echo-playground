- **Acknowledgments:** Hats off to the Echo framework team and OpenAI for their incredible tools.

## Notes

- **Docker Builds:** Differentiating between development and production. Use Docker Compose for simplicity.
- **.env File Handling:** Use `--env-file .env` with Docker to ensure environment variables are correctly passed into the container.
- **Deployment:** ECS deployment assumes production setup does not rely on `.env`.

Remember, your `.env` file is your secret diary. Keep it safe and out of version control. üóùÔ∏è
